# cicd-kubernetes-project

I built the environment needed for this project on AWS using Terraform.
I explored using Jenkins and Github-actions as my tool for continuous integration and deployment. As a result, i have also provided the file for both options in the repo.

I depoyed my portoflio app, sock-shock app, and set up monitoring and alerting  using prometheus and grafana with cloud watch as my logging tool. I also set up Honeycomb.io for traces, everything needed for observability(metrics, logs and trace).

I also got a certificate from letsencrypt using Kubernetes certificate manager.

Below are screenshot of the apps deployed  as i had to put off my instances due to the cost.
